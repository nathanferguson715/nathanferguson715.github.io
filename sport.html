                Sport climbing, also know as "Lead Climbing" is a form of rope climbing where the climber clips their rope into pre-drilled bolts that have been placed into rock every five to ten feet while they ascend the climb. 
                The climber must bring quickdraws, or carabiners connected with a length of sling between them in order to attach to the permanent bolts placed into the rock. The belayer, or person on the 
                ground must use proper belaying technique in order to feed rope to the climber so that they can continue climbing without getting stuck. If the climber falls while attempting a move they will 
                be caught by the belayer on the ground who is managing the rope with a belay device. The video to the right showcases how a sport climbing fall works and some technique surrounding it.

            <h1>Ropes</h1>
            <p>Ropes are an essential part of sport climbing as they are needed to protect the climber in case of a fall. Ropes range in length from 30m-80m+ depending on the length of your climb. Ropes come in different
                diameters with the typical ranging from 9.2mm thick to 10.5mm thick.

            <h1>Belay Devices</h1>
            <p>Belay devices are used by the belayer (person on the ground holding the rope) to make sure the climber doesn't fall all the way to the ground. The belay device creates friction with the rope to stop the rope
            and therefore the climber from falling all the way to the ground. The belay device doesn't prevent the fall, it just stops the fall from being too large.

            <h1>Quickdraws</h1>
            <p>Quickdraws are two carabiners linked together with a length of sling. Climbers will clip their rope to these "draws" in order to protect themselves as they climb up the rock face. A typical sport climb with take 8-12 
            draws to get to the top of the climb. It's always good practice to bring more than you think you will need for the climb. If you run out of protection you either have to lower to the ground to gather more 
            equiptment or finish the climb without any more protection.

                <p>A harness is a must have for rope climbers as this is what catches the climber if they fall. Harnesses range in sizes, weight, and color, but ultimatly they all do the same thing!
