                Traditional, or "Trad" Climbing for short is a form of climbing where the leading climber places pieces of protection (“pro” for short) as they ascend the climb. 
                Protection pieces come in multiple forms which include cams, nuts, and hexes. Once the lead climber finishes the climb a second climber will then ascend the route and 
                remove the gear as they work their way up. Should the climber fall while climbing the pieces of protection along with the help of the belayer will catch the climber from falling to the ground.

            <h2>Cams</h2>
            <p>Cams are active pieces of gear which adjust dynamically in size to fit the different sized crack or split in a rock. If the lead 
                climber falls, their protection will catch them assuming they are placed correctly.</p>

            <h2>Nuts</h2>
            <p>Nuts are passive pieces of gear which are placed into cracks into the rock to act as a temporary bolt
                for the climber to attach their rope to.</p>

        <div class="tradpro_item">
            <h2>Hexs</h2>
            <p>Hexs are another form of passive proteciton which is placed into cracks similar to nuts. The main different is that hexes tend to be larger and differently shaped.</p>
