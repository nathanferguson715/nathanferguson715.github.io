                Climbing is a popular recreational activity which comes in multiple styles. Climbing was first developed as a sport around the late 19th century and has gained popularity ever since. From the 1980’s onward, 
                climbing has become a widespread recreational and competitive activity around the world. There are three main types of climbing which includes <b>traditional climbing</b>, <b>sport climbing</b>, 
                and <b>bouldering</b>. Each style of climbing has unique characteristics which defines them as different styles. Each form of climbing requires different skills and techniques in order to master them. Both traditional
                and sport climbing require the use of a belayer to protect the climber. The belayer is the person who stands on the ground and uses a belay device to catch the climber on the rope should they fall.
